        Picture rendering switched to Dragonfly middleware
        --------------------------------------------------

        Alchemy now uses the Dragonfly middleware to render the pictures and
        REMOVED THE LOCAL PICTURE CACHING!

        This has effect on your production setup and NEEDS FURTHER ACTION in order to
        provide a caching option that works for your setup.

        Please follow the guidelines about picture caching on the Dragonfly homepage:

        http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/cache/

        NOTE
        todo notice, 'Alchemy v3.5 changes'
      end
    end
