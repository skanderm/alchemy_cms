  JSON API moved into '/api' namespace
  ------------------------------------

  The JSON API now lives under /api and not as additional format to default controllers.
  Also the serialization changed into more useful payload.

  Please upgrade your API calls to use the new /api namespace.


  TinyMCE default paste behavior changed
  --------------------------------------

  Text is now always pasted in as plain text. To change this, the user has to
  disable it with the toolbar button, as they had to before to enable it.

  If you have a custom TinyMCE configuration you have to enable this by adding

    paste_as_text: true

  into you custom TinyMCE configuration.


  TinyMCE toolbar config has changed
  ----------------------------------

  The 'toolbar' configuration now takes an array of toolbar rows, instead of
  using 'toolbarN' syntax. Please update your TinyMCE configuration.

  Visit http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:toolbar for more information.


  ApplicationController patch removed
  -----------------------------------

  If you have controllers that loads Alchemy content or uses Alchemy helpers in
  the views (i.e. `render_navigation` or `render_elements`) you should

    include Alchemy::ControllerActions

  in these controllers.


  NOTE
        todo notice, 'Alchemy v3.1 changes'
      end
    end
